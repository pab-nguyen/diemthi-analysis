Analysis of Vietnamese High School Graduate Test Results 2020  

In Vietnam, high school graduates need to take a standardized college entrance exam to get considered for higher education. They need to take five subject tests: Maths, Literature, English, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences. Parents and students prepare three years of high school for this one exam, which in many peopleâ€™s opinions determine your future. Before 2015, students has to take two exams: one deciding whether they graduate high school, and the other is the college entrance exam. These two exams now became one, therefore it is extremely stressful for students in their last year of high school.  

I was interested to see the results of the students. In this project, I scraped 74,000 exam takers scores in 2020 from the official Government website, analyzed it then visualized in with Tableau to give the audience insights on this exam.
